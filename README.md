# Dynamic-Land-Use-Transport-Model

# Description
This repository contains the Vensim model for a dynamic Land Use-Transport Interaction (LUTI) model, designed to analyse the relationship between land use changes and transportation demand over time. The model incorporates various factors influencing travel demand, supply, residential relocation, and urban development, with a focus on dynamic interactions and feedback loops between land use patterns and mobility choices.
